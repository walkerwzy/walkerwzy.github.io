<p>Youtube is back! The users of mainland China can visit it now. It seems that the Great Fire wall does not bother it any long.But nobody know the reason just like nobody know why Youtube was blocked two weeks ago. The 2008 Olympic Game is just around the corner, millions of visitor will use Youtube to upload their videos. Maybe this is the reason why Cisco Co. let its Great Fire wall release the youtube. Will it free the Wikipedia and feedburner? Nobody knows. </p>
<p>But as the old chinese saying said: Dog will always eat the shit, No one can promise that the great firewall will never block the Youtube in next week or next month. Bush's government can drop millions tons of bombs to teach Sadam how to respect the value of free world.But it seems that it can not teach Cisco Co. what the "don't be evil" is. So, take the shit when it is still hot.<br /><br />引用地址：<a href="http://www.caobian.info/?p=2662">http://www.caobian.info/?p=2662</a><br /><br />这是一中文博客，中文博客上用纯英文写作，原因很多，有刻意，也有无奈。但是原因是无奈的话，只能让人出离愤怒，除了愤怒，你还能做什么？google的don't be evil确实应该好好地给Cisco上一课，狠上一课。<br /><br />另外，北京啥网什么什么会的责成百度为艳照事件道歉~~~互联网世界果然让我们的想象力相形见绌，这什么破协会，太有才了！相反作为一家搜索引擎公司，什么都搜不到才更应该道歉，MMD，逼老子骂人。</p></div></p>
