刚刚为自己选择了痛苦的无间地狱，却突然听歌听到"daughter of mercy"这句歌词，是啊，mercy是仁慈，是宽恕，多么温暖的一个词，我也来感激这个给我带来温暖的声音，Maria Solheim<br />
Too Many Days--Maria Solheim</p>

<p>Too many days I wake up with an aching <br />
Too many days have been wasted like sand <br />
Too many hours have gone by without notice <br />
Too many times I’ve let go of your hand </p>

<p>Lay by the sea, bury all of your fear <br />
Lady lay <br />
Lay by the sea, you are wild, you are free <br />
You are daughter of mercy, daughter of strength </p>

<p>All of the time I’m reminded of failures <br />
My tongue has bathed in spit from a thief <br />
(I am) dancing as close as I can to desire <br />
(I am) repeating my shortcomings loud to myself </p>

<p>Lay by the sea, bury all of your fear <br />
Lady lay <br />
Lay by the sea, you are wild, you are free <br />
You are daughter of mercy, daughter of strength </p>

<p>Too many years have been wasted like money <br />
Too many nights I wake up with a cry <br />
Too many years have gone by without notice <br />
Too many times I have wanted to die </p>

<p>Lay by the sea, bury all of your fear <br />
Lady lay <br />
Lay by the sea, you are wild, you are free <br />
You are daughter of mercy, daughter of strength</p>
