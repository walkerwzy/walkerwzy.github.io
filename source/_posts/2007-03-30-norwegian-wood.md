<p>当初把QQ昵称改为挪威森林的时候，我做了一个极其痛苦只为让自己解脱的决定。<br />这两天老是听到什么鸟啊鸟的，让我又想起了the beatles的这首歌，norwegian wood(挪威的森林)<br />因为它有另一个名字，this bird has flown...<br /><br />Once I had a girl <br />Or should I say she once had me <br />She showed me her room <br />Isn't it good Norwegian wood? <br /><br />She asked me to stay <br />And she told me to sit anywhere <br />So I looked around <br />And I noticed there wasn't a chair <br /><br />I sat on a rug biding my time <br />drinking her wine <br />We talked until two and then she said <br />"it's time for bed" <br /><br />She told me she worked <br />in the morning and started to laugh <br />I told her I didn't <br />and crawled off to sleep in the bath <br /><br />And when I awoke I was alone <br />This bird had flown <br />So I lit a fire <br />Isn't it good Norwegian wood? </p>
