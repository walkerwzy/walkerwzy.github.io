No More Lovesongs<br />
最真诚的心做最纯粹的音乐，那些本该阴霾的情绪，却哼唱出了轻快的曲调，让人心醉<br />
《No More Lovesongs》,选自Lacrosse的《This New Year Will Be For You And Me》</p>

<p>I've had it up to here (now you know)<br />
your stealing and cheating and all your lies<br />
No more chances for you (no no no)<br />
No more chances for you (no no no)</p>

<p>So I follow you around - Not a word from you<br />
you can even hear my heart break</p>

<p>No more lovesongs for you<br />
No more songs at all for you<br />
One day you'll be alone<br />
And where will I be then ' I'll be gone</p>

<p>I am not invisible, I'm not blind<br />
Everybody can see me cry<br />
Everyone but you (oh oh oh)<br />
everyone but you (no no no)<br />
And so I follow you around - You are laughing now<br />
But I'll be laughing too (before you know) ' and you know</p>

<p>No more lovesongs for you<br />
No more songs at all for you<br />
One day you'll be alone<br />
And that's when I'll be gone ' I'll be gone</p>

<p>No more love songs for you<br />
This is the last time I'll say<br />
that I ever loved you<br />
But this is the last time I swear<br />
One day you'll be alone<br />
And there will be no songs for you (no no no)<br />
And there will be no songs for you (no no no no no no)</p>
