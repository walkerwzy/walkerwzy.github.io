<p>i've had a nightmare last night.</p>

<p>i've had a nightmare last night.</p>

<p>in the dream,i've lost the most important things which seems i don't cared about in the real life,in the normal times.</p>

<p>i thought i can't be hurted in the further,but why so sad so pain in my heart when you leave me alone again.i'm so scared...</p>

<p>it's just a dream,a nightmare,but i know,something has changed,must have been changed.</p>

<p>what has changed? you? me? or the other things?</p>

<p>waht makes me so frighten,let me be another fragile man,let be a man cares about every thing...</p>

<p>the only words i remembered,i do not want to say something about my feelings,so i used english,just like i've never said.who cares about that wheather the grammer it right or not.</p>

<p>i'm still recalling the nightmare,the feelings that can't be described in words. </p>
