<p>CHOP SUEY! </p>

<p>Wake up,</p>

<p>Grab a brush and put a little (makeup),<br />
Grab a brush and put a little,<br />
Hide the scars to fade away the (shakeup)</p>

<p>Hide the scars to fade away the,<br />
Why'd you leave the keys upon the table?<br />
Here you go create another fable<br />
You wanted to,<br />
Grab a brush and put a little makeup,<br />
You wanted to,<br />
Hide the scars to fade away the shakeup,<br />
You wanted to,<br />
Why'd you leave the keys upon the table,<br />
You wanted to,</p>

<p>I don't think you trust,<br />
In, my, self righteous suicide,<br />
I, cry, when angels deserve to die, Die,</p>

<p>Father, Father, Father, Father,<br />
Father/ Into your hands/I/commend my spirit,<br />
Father, into your hands,</p>

<p>Why have you forsaken me,<br />
In your eyes forsaken me,<br />
In your thoughts forsaken me,<br />
In your heart forsaken, me oh,</p>

<p>Trust in my self righteous suicide,<br />
I, cry, when angels deserve to die,<br />
In my self righteous suicide,<br />
I, cry, when angels deserve to die.</p>
