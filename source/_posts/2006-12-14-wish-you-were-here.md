<p>So, so you think you can tell Heaven from Hell, blue skies from pain.<br />Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail? A smile from a veil?<br />Do you think you can tell?<br /><br />And did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts? Hot ashes for trees?<br />Hot air for a cool breeze? Cold comfort for change?<br />And did you exchange a walk on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?<br /><br />How I wish, how I wish you were here.<br />We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, year after year,<br />Running over the same old ground. What have you found? The same old fears.<br />Wish you were here.<br /><br />狂多经典乐队翻唱的一首歌曲，足证其魅力所在。<br />开头的几个音符就已经让人着迷。And so do the lyrics.<br />Pink Floyd forever </p>
