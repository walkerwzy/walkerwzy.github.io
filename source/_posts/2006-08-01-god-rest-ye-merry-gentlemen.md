<p>一首英国民谣，对了，它就是被小安改编张韶涵演唱的《寓言》。老实说改编得不错，二胡，诡异的电吉他，很有创意的。英文原曲颇有宗教氛围，当然了，它本身就是首圣诞歌曲嘛。网上有很多版本，我提供的是维也纳童声合唱团的版本。<br />
god rest ye merry, gentlemen, <br />
let nothing you dismay <br />
remember christ our saviour <br />
was born on christmas day <br />
to save us all from satan's power <br />
when we were gone astray. <br />
o tidings of comfort and joy, <br />
comfort and joy; <br />
o tidings of comfort and joy! </p>

<p>"fear not," then said the angel <br />
"let nothing you affright <br />
this day is born a saviour <br />
of a pure virgin bright <br />
to free all those who trust in him <br />
from satan's pow'r and might" <br />
o tidings of comfort and joy, <br />
comfort and joy; <br />
o tidings of comfort and joy! </p>

<p>the shepherds at those tidings <br />
rejoiced much in mind, <br />
and left their flocks a-feeding <br />
in tempest, storm and wind <br />
and went to bethlehem straightaway <br />
this blessed babe to find <br />
o tidings of comfort and joy, <br />
comfort and joy; <br />
o tidings of comfort and joy! </p>

<p>but when to bethlehem they came <br />
whereat this infant lay <br />
they found him in a manger <br />
where oxen feed on hay <br />
his mother mary kneeling <br />
unto the lord did pray <br />
o tidings of comfort and joy, <br />
comfort and joy; <br />
o tidings of comfort and joy! </p>

<p>now to the lord sing praises <br />
all you within this place <br />
and with true love and brotherhood <br />
each other now embrace <br />
this holy tide of christmas <br />
all others doth deface <br />
o tidings of comfort and joy, <br />
comfort and joy; <br />
o tidings of comfort and joy.</p>
