<p><div>well I don't know why, but appranly it's no need to know, also you have no chance to figure everything out. Just two story, two separate story,two individual story, every unique life of their own. It's nothing about the fate, but yourself. No blame, but sadness, which can nobody ever touch it.</div>
<div>I'm not happy, damn sure, not even a little, also I can't make people happy, I produce misery, and I sell it, and I buy it...</div>
<div>You all got tired, gave up and run away, far far away, left me here, struggle still</div>
<div>It's ever been a short time but now, it's really a long long time, forever might it be.</div>
<div>Never recover...</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span">Happy together</span> is just a song, and don't stand for anything, can't stand for anything</div></p>
